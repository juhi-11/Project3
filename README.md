# Image Generation using OpenAI's DALL-E Model
1. Import Libraries: The code imports necessary libraries for interacting with OpenAI, downloading images, handling images, and creating a web interface.
2. Set API Key The OpenAI API key is set for authentication.
3. Define Function: The `generate_image` function takes a description, generates an image using the OpenAI API, downloads it, and returns it.
4. Web App Interface: When the "Generate Image" button is clicked, it calls the function to generate and display the image.
The result is a web app where users can enter a description, and the app will generate and show an image based on that description.
